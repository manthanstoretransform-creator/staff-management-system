/**
 * Screenshots, for the people allowed to see someone else's.
 *
 * Two audiences share this screen, and the difference between them is the
 * member picker:
 *
 * - **Admin / HR** (`canViewAllScreenshots`) open on *every* employee — one
 *   request to `/time-entry-screenshots/day` for the selected day — and can
 *   narrow with the member filter. Each employee is an accordion section
 *   headed by their name and the time they worked, so a long roster is a list
 *   you scan rather than a page you scroll.
 * - **A leader** reaches this route too — they hold `view_employees`, which is
 *   what gates the read-only `/admin` screens — but screenshots are not part of
 *   a leader's authority over their team. They get no picker, and the request
 *   pins `user_id` to themselves.
 *
 * The day is the unit of this screen: it opens on today, and inside a member's
 * section the captures are grouped into hour rows, each headed by the time
 * actually worked in that hour. The hour is what someone reviewing a day looks
 * for; the ten-minute capture windows live inside it as cards.
 *
 * Everything here comes from the API. There is no local sample data: a day
 * with no captures renders an empty state that says so, because a stand-in
 * image on a monitoring screen is a claim about a person that is not true.
