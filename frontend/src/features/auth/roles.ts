 * backend gates `GET /feedback` on the role name itself
 * (`FEEDBACK_VIEW_ALL_ROLES` in `app/services/feedback.py`), so mirroring that
 * role list is what keeps the sidebar from offering a page the API would
 * answer with 403. The two lists must stay in step — if a role is added to one,
 * add it to the other.
 *
 * `org_admin` / `super_admin` and `project_leader` are the alternate spellings
 * the backend's ROLE_PERMISSIONS table already defines for admin and leader
 * authority; `administrator` is the WordPress slug the provider sends for an
 * admin, which the backend resolves through its alias table.

 * the roster, the dashboard and their team's timesheets — but not this. A leader
 * and an employee both see exactly one person's captures: their own.
 *
 * This is a *role* list rather than a permission because the backend has no
 * separate screenshot permission to mirror: `TimeEntryScreenshotService`
 * authorises reads through the general member scope, which would let a leader
 * through. The gate therefore lives here, and a leader's own screenshots come
 * from the endpoint's caller-pinned default rather than from a `user_id`.

 * and `hr` and to nobody else — deliberately not to a leader or a manager, who
 * may see their team's captures but may not delete them, and not to an employee
 * for their own. So the check reads the permission the user was actually issued
 * rather than a second copy of the role list, and a grant changed on the server
 * reaches this button with no frontend change.
 *
 * Hiding the control is presentation only. The endpoint refuses the request
 * regardless, which is what actually enforces this.
