"""
Coverage for who may be assigned a project task, and for the endpoint that
tells a client who those people are.

POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/tasks accepts an assignee only if they are an
active employee who is a member of the project. That rule is correct; making
the field *required* was not, because the desktop then had to invent a value
and the only id it held was the signed-in user's -- which works for an
employee and is refused with HTTP 400 for an admin or a leader. The field is
now optional and the rule applies only when a value is given.
