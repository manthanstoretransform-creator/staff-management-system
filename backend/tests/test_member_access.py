"""End-to-end route tests for the member-side Dashboard and Reports.

The member pages in the web client reuse the admin endpoints rather than
having their own. That only works if two things hold at the same time, and
these tests pin both:

 1. A caller *without* ``time_entries:view_all`` is no longer refused. The
    employee role never had that permission, so while the routes required it
    every member-side screen was a 403.
 2. That caller's scope is pinned to themselves in the service, not merely in
    the UI. The request goes through the real router and dependency chain, so
    a ``?member_id=`` naming somebody else must still come out as the caller's
    own id by the time the service sees it.
