"""Deleting a screenshot: who may, and what must be gone afterwards.

Two layers, because the rules live in two places and a test at one layer cannot
see the other.

The *route* tests go through the real router and dependency chain, since the
role gate is a route dependency (`require_screenshot_delete`) — a service-level
test would pass no matter what that dependency said. They pin the one thing the
frontend must not be trusted with: an employee's DELETE is refused with 403 even
though the UI would never show them the control.

The *service* tests mock the session and Google Drive, and pin the ordering that
makes this operation safe to retry. Drive first, then the row: a Drive failure
must leave the screenshot whole and reportable, because deleting the row first
would leave the image readable in storage with nothing left pointing at it. A
Drive object that is already gone is the one failure that must not block, or a
screenshot whose bytes were removed out of band could never be cleaned up.
