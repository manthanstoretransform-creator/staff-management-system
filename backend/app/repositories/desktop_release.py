"""Data access for ``desktop_releases``.

Repositories own SQL and nothing else. The rules about *which* release a given
client should be offered, and whether that client is behind it, live in
``app.services.desktop_release`` — there is one comparison rule in this system
and this is not where it is written.

The one piece of judgement that does belong here is the ordering, because it is
a property of the query: releases are ordered by the three integer version
columns, never by the version string. A string sort puts ``1.9.0`` after
``1.10.0``, which would offer a fleet a downgrade and call it an update.
