"""Idle time and idle-time reassignment.

This module is the ONE authoritative implementation of the idle rules. The
desktop detects inactivity and reports it; it never decides whether idle time
counts, how long the idle period was, or where reassigned time lands.

How idle time is removed from tracked time
------------------------------------------
`time_entries.total_seconds` is never edited. It stays exactly what the timer
measured, which is what the desktop's offline sync reconciles against. Idle
time that must not be counted is removed with a NEGATIVE
`time_entry_adjustments` row -- the same auditable mechanism the
unwanted-activity rules already use -- so every aggregation that nets
adjustments (reports, the reports page, the dashboard, and now time-tracking)
excludes it without any per-report special casing.

The counting rule
-----------------
    count_idle_time = keep_idle_time is True and action == "resume"

Every other combination discards, including "keep idle time" followed by
"stop timer".

Reassignment
------------
Reassigning does not move the original entry's project/task -- that would
also move the legitimate work done *before* the user went idle. Instead the
idle seconds elapsed up to the moment Reassign was pressed are:

  1. written as a separate, already-stopped time entry on the destination
     project/task covering exactly that window, and
  2. deducted from the original entry with a matching negative adjustment.

So the seconds are counted exactly once, under the destination, and the
original entry keeps only the work that really belonged to it. Activity, app
usage, URL usage and screenshot rows are never moved or split: they stay
attached to the original entry, whose row is untouched, so referential
integrity is preserved by construction.

Residual idle time (from the moment Reassign was pressed until the user
finally answers the popup) is not part of the reassignment and follows the
ordinary keep/discard rule at resolution.
