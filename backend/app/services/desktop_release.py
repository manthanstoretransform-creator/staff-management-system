"""Desktop release policy: what a client should install, and who is on what.

Three responsibilities:

1. **Answer the desktop's update check.** Given what the caller is running and
   the machine it is running on, decide whether a newer *compatible* build
   exists and whether taking it is mandatory. Every comparison rule in this
   system lives here, in one place, so a client never has to decide for itself
   whether it is out of date.

2. **Answer the website's download button.** The same lookup, unauthenticated
   and narrowed, so the download link is always the current release rather than
   a versioned URL that ages badly.

3. **Record which version each user is running**, for fleet visibility. This
   happens on the same authenticated request, so it costs nothing extra.

Where releases come from
------------------------
The ``desktop_releases`` table is the source of truth. The three configuration
values that used to be the whole answer (``DESKTOP_LATEST_VERSION`` and
friends) are kept as a **fallback**, and only as one: a deployment that has
registered no releases yet still answers exactly as it did before this table
existed. That is deliberate backward compatibility, not a second mechanism --
as soon as one published row exists for the platform, the table wins and the
configuration is ignored.

Withdrawal still works the way the release runbook says it does. Moving a row
off ``published`` removes it from every lookup here immediately, and clearing
``DESKTOP_LATEST_VERSION`` still withdraws a configuration-only answer.
