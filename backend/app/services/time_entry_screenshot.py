"""time_entry_screenshot — Storing, serving and grouping desktop screenshots.

Three responsibilities, in the order the product uses them:

1. **Upload.** Validate the image, authorise it against the *authenticated*
   session rather than against anything the request body claims, put the bytes
   in Google Drive under Year/Month/User/Date, and write the metadata row —
   idempotently on the client's own `client_screenshot_id`.
2. **View.** Stream one screenshot back to a caller who is allowed to see it.
   The bytes are proxied, never linked: a Drive URL would outlive the
   permission check and would require the folder to be public.
3. **Timeline.** Group screenshots and activity into the same fixed windows the
   desktop captures against, so a window's activity percentage describes that
   window and nothing else.
4. **Delete.** Destroy one capture — the Drive object first, then the metadata
   row — for an administrator or HR. This is the only destructive operation in
   the module, and the only one that is not available to the person whose day
   the screenshot describes.

        The caller has already been checked for the `screenshots:delete`
        permission by the route dependency — that gate is what limits this to
        administrators and HR, and it deliberately lives on the route so it
        cannot be reached around by another service calling in here. What is
        left to enforce is *which* screenshot: the row must belong to the

        the same reason the view endpoint does — a 403 on a guessed id confirms
        the id exists.
