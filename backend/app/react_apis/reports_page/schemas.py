"""Pydantic schemas for the React Reports page APIs.

Every one of the four report tabs (Project / Task / App / URL) returns the
same metric shape -- ``total_hours``, ``avg_activity``, ``total_members``,
``total_tasks`` -- alongside the entity's own id/name, so the frontend can
render all four tabs with one table component.
