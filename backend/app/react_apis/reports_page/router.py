"""React Reports page endpoints: /api/v1/react/reports/*.

Six endpoints share one filter model -- a date range plus optional
project/task/member narrowing -- so the frontend can move between the
Project, Task, App and URL tabs (and the common summary strip and trend
chart above them) without changing how it builds a request.

Dates are IST calendar dates. The range is inclusive of both ends: internally
it becomes ``>= start_date 00:00 IST`` and ``< end_date + 1 day 00:00 IST``,
so work recorded late on the end date is included.
