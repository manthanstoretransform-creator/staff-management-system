"""React Dashboard endpoints: /api/v1/react/dashboard[/projects|/members|/apps].

``GET /dashboard`` returns everything the page needs for its first render --
summary cards, the Time Tracked series, and the top 10 projects, members and
apps -- in one request. The three list endpoints exist for the "View All"
links, so the initial load never has to carry a large dataset.

All four accept the same filter set the Reports page uses, and it is the same
code path: dates are IST calendar dates, inclusive at both ends, defaulting to
the last 7 calendar days including today. Every section of every response is
computed from that one resolved filter set, so the cards, the chart and the
three lists can never disagree with each other or with Reports.
