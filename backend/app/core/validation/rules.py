"""The single catalogue of input rules shared by the whole application.

Every user-controlled field in this system is described by exactly one
:class:`Rule`. The rule says what the field *is* — a person's name, a free-text
description, an email, a password, an identifier — and the limits below say how
long it may be. Nothing else in the backend should invent its own length cap or
its own email regex; before this module existed the email pattern was written
out twice in ``app/schemas/member.py`` alone and every schema picked its own
maximum length by hand.

The three clients of this catalogue are deliberately kept in step:

* ``backend/app/core/validation``  — the final authority (this package)
* ``desktop/core/validation``      — the same rules, for early feedback
* ``frontend/src/validation``      — the same rules again, in TypeScript

If you change a limit here, change it in the other two. The tests in
``backend/tests/test_validation_framework.py`` and
``desktop/tests/test_validation_framework.py`` assert the numbers agree.

Adding a new field? Pick the rule that matches its meaning. Only add a *new*
rule when a genuinely new kind of data arrives — not when an existing kind
needs a different length, which is what ``max_length`` overrides are for.

# Structured-content detection

# These are the *secondary* defence. The primary defence is that every field
# above has an expected type, a length and a format. What follows only rejects
# content that is structurally wrong for a plain-text field — markup, script,
# a whole JSON document, a whole XML document — and it is written to be
# specific so that ordinary prose survives.
#
# Deliberate trade-off, so that a future reader does not think it accidental:
# a sentence like "wrap it in a <div>" is rejected from a description, because
# the pattern cannot tell that apart from injected markup. Comparisons such as
# "5 < 10" and arrows such as "a -> b" are unaffected, because a tag requires
# "<" to be followed immediately by a letter or a slash.
