# backend/app/core/permissions.py
#
# This table is the login gate: AuthService.login_exchange refuses any role that
# is missing a key here, with 502 "Invalid authentication provider response".
# That makes it the second half of a pair -- `MemberRole` in app/schemas/member.py
# says which roles a member may be *given*, and this says which roles may
# *sign in*. When the two drift apart you can create a member nobody can log in
# as, which is exactly what happened to `leader` and then to `hr`. Every
# MemberRole value must have an entry here; tests/test_auth_flow.py pins that.

# `manual_time_entries:create_for_others` is filing a manual entry *on somebody
# else's behalf*, and it is deliberately narrower than being able to read other
# people's time. `time_entries:view_all` used to double as both, which handed
# every role that could see the organisation's hours the ability to write hours
# onto anyone's timesheet -- including a leader, whose authority over their team
# is supervisory: they see their members' tracked time and approve or reject the
# requests those members file, but the entry itself must originate with the
# person whose day it describes.

# `administrator`, which is exactly Monitra's `admin`. An admin account that
# was provisioned as `admin` began coming back from the provider as
# roles: ["administrator"], which matches no key in ROLE_PERMISSIONS, so the
# login was refused with 502 -- the same failure `leader` and `hr` hit, one
# spelling further out.
#
# This table only renames; it never invents authority. An alias must point at
# a role ROLE_PERMISSIONS already defines, and it is applied before the
# membership check, so an aliased role is held to exactly the permission set
# its Monitra target carries. Only unambiguous slugs belong here: the other
# WordPress core roles (editor, author, contributor, subscriber) have no
# clean Monitra equivalent and are deliberately left unmapped so they are
# refused rather than silently granted access.
