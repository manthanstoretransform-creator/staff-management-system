"""One published (or draft) build of the Monitra desktop client.

Why this table exists
---------------------
The update check used to answer from three configuration values --
``DESKTOP_LATEST_VERSION``, ``DESKTOP_DOWNLOAD_URL``,
``DESKTOP_RELEASE_NOTES_URL``. That was honest and sufficient for an
announcement, but it cannot describe a release: it holds one version for the
whole fleet, so a Windows client and a macOS client are told about the same
artifact, and there is nowhere to record the checksum an auto-updater has to
verify before it runs anything. An updater that downloads and executes a file
it cannot verify is strictly worse than the manual download it replaces.

So a release is a row: one row per *artifact*, because that is the unit a
client actually downloads. Version 2.0.0 is four rows — Windows x86_64, macOS
arm64, macOS x86_64, and the Windows portable zip if one is published — and
each carries its own URL, size and digest.

Scope
-----
Releases are product-wide, not per-organisation. There is deliberately no
``organization_id``: the desktop build is the same software for everyone, and
scoping it per tenant would mean a release could be published for one customer
and silently withheld from another with no way to tell which state was
intended.

Rollback
--------
Rows are never deleted. ``status`` is the only lever, and moving a release to
``disabled`` or ``rolled_back`` immediately stops it being offered — the
lookup only ever considers ``published``. Keeping the row is what makes the
prior version still reachable for a rollback, and what keeps a support report
naming a withdrawn build resolvable.
