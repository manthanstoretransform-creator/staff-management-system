"""Schemas for desktop releases, the update check, and fleet visibility.

Backward compatibility note: ``LatestVersionResponse`` and the two fleet
schemas are the shapes production desktop clients already consume. Fields have
been *added* to the update-check response and nothing has been removed or
renamed, so a client built against the old shape keeps working unchanged —
it simply ignores the new keys. The desktop's own parser reads by key and
tolerates absent ones, which is what makes that safe in both directions during
a rollout.
