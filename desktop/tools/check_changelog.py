check_changelog — a release cannot ship without a written release note.

GitHub's auto-generated notes list commit titles. That is not the same thing
as telling a member of staff what changed for them, and it is the only thing a
release carried before this check existed. So: if `version.py` names a version,
`CHANGELOG.md` must have a heading for it.

    python tools/check_changelog.py

Exit status is non-zero when the current version has no entry. The check is
deliberately shallow — it verifies that a human wrote *something* under a
heading for this version, not what they wrote.
