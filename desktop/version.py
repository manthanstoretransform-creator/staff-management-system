"""
version — the single source of truth for Monitra desktop identity.

Every place that needs to name or version this application reads from here:

    - the Qt application object (main.py)
    - the Windows .exe version resource (packaging/monitra.spec)
    - the Windows installer (packaging/windows/monitra.iss, generated from here)
    - the macOS Info.plist / bundle identifier (packaging/monitra.spec)
    - the DMG volume name (scripts/build_macos.sh)
    - the "About" line in the UI

Nothing else may hardcode a version string. A build whose installer claims
1.2.0 while the .exe metadata says 1.0.0 is worse than having no version at
all, because it makes support reports untrustworthy — so this module exists
to make the duplicate impossible.

Bumping a release is therefore exactly one edit: VERSION below.

VERSION must stay a plain three-part `major.minor.patch` string. Windows'
VERSIONINFO resource and macOS' CFBundleVersion both require numeric-only
components, so a suffix like "1.0.0-rc1" would have to be stripped in two
places and would drift. Pre-release identity belongs in the artifact
filename, which the build scripts derive, not in this constant.
