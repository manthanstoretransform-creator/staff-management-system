"""
Foreground-window detection: which application/window the user is currently
in, and its window title -- the signal both app-usage tracking
(background_services/activity/app_usage_service.py) and browser URL
tracking (background_services/activity/url_usage_service.py) are built on.
Both of those consumers only need (app_name, window_title); everything
below that is platform plumbing.

**Windows** -- GetForegroundWindow + GetWindowThreadProcessId +
QueryFullProcessImageNameW, via ctypes. No new dependency, no elevated
privileges.

**macOS** -- NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication() for the app name, plus
Quartz's CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo for that process's on-screen window
title (a process can have zero on-screen windows, e.g. a menu-bar-only
app, in which case the app name is still reported with no window title).
Requires the `pyobjc-framework-Cocoa` and `pyobjc-framework-Quartz`
packages (see requirements.txt's `sys_platform == "darwin"` markers) --
neither installs on Windows, so this module still imports cleanly there.

IMPORTANT macOS caveat: starting with Catalina, `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo`
only returns real window titles (`kCGWindowName`) if this process has been
granted **Screen Recording** permission in System Settings -> Privacy &
Security. Without it, the call itself does not fail or raise -- it just
silently omits window names, so app-usage tracking still works (app name
is unaffected) but URL tracking (which needs the window title to read a
browser's address bar / tab title) will see empty titles until permission
is granted. This module cannot request that permission itself; the user
has to grant it once, the same way any screen-recording app on macOS asks.

**Every other platform** (Linux, etc.) -- no implementation. Reports no
data rather than fabricating a placeholder: both consumers already treat
"no active-window signal" as "nothing to attribute this second to", the
same way background_services/activity/input_probe.py already handles
platforms with no supported input-idle API.
