"""
uia — Read a browser's address bar through Windows UI Automation.

Why this module exists
----------------------
Before it, no browser adapter had *any* real URL source. `ChromeAdapter`
carried a `_extract_via_uia()` that unconditionally returned `None`, so the
only signal left was the window title, and a title like "ChatGPT - SMS"
contains no URL at all. The pipeline then invented one: the title parser
returned no domain, `normalize_domain_and_url` fell back to the sentinel
`"unknown-domain"`, and the summary builder rendered it as the link
`https://unknown-domain`. That is fabricated data of exactly the kind
CLAUDE.md §2 forbids.

This reads the actual address bar instead. UI Automation is the mechanism
Chromium and Gecko already expose to screen readers, so it needs no browser
extension, no automation/debugging port, no injected code and no elevation.

Implementation notes
--------------------
The COM plumbing is raw ctypes vtable dispatch rather than `comtypes`, to
keep `requirements.txt` (PySide6, httpx, python-dotenv, pynput, tzdata) as
it is -- adding a COM binding to every packaged build for one address-bar
read is not a trade worth making.

COM apartments are per-thread, so the `IUIAutomation` instance is created
lazily per thread and cached in a thread-local. In practice only the
`url_usage` service thread ever calls in here, which is the point: nothing
on the GUI thread blocks on a UIA round trip.

Measured cost on the development machine: ~8 ms for Chrome, ~29 ms for
Edge, and ~85 ms for a Firefox window that exposes no address bar (the
whole-subtree search has to fail before returning). Callers are expected to
avoid paying even that on every sample -- see `ChromiumAdapter`'s
title-keyed memoisation.
