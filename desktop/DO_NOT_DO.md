# DO NOT DO — Monitra Desktop

Every entry below is an anti-pattern that was **actually present** in this
codebase and the **specific production failure it caused**. They are recorded so
the same defects are not reintroduced, and so a reviewer can point at the reason
rather than at a preference.

Most are enforced mechanically by `tools/read tools/check_architecture.py`. The
rest are enforced by the regression suite. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
for what to do instead.

## Threading

### ❌ Do not connect a UI slot to a polling signal

```python
# WAS: sync_queue.run() emitted this on every 500ms poll of an empty queue
self._sync_queue.queue_empty.connect(self._on_queue_empty)

def _on_queue_empty(self):
    self._on_project_selected(self._current_project)   # spawns a QThread
    self._load_today_time()                            # spawns a QThread
```

**What it caused:** two new OS threads and two HTTP requests **every second,
forever**, in a completely idle application. Instrumented reproduction measured
**48 worker threads in 25 seconds**, still climbing. This single defect produced
the UI freezing, the loader never resolving, the thread pile-up, the API request
storm, and most of the "works on one run, fails on the next" behaviour.

**Instead:** emit edges, not levels. `queue_drained` fires once on the
non-empty → empty transition; `pending_count_changed` only when the number
changes.

### ❌ Do not give a worker a signal named `finished`

```python
class BaseWorker(QThread):
    finished = Signal(dict)      # shadows QThread.finished

worker.finished.connect(worker.deleteLater)
```

**What it caused:** `QThread: Destroyed while thread '<name>' is still running`.
The custom `finished` is emitted from *inside* `run()`, so `deleteLater()`
scheduled destruction of the QThread while it was still executing. There were
~14 such call sites.

**Instead:** don't subclass QThread for one-shot work at all — use
`api.run_in_background(...)`.

### ❌ Do not create QThreads outside the runtime layer

Widgets, dialogs, and feature modules must not instantiate `QThread`,
`QThreadPool` or `QRunnable`. A transient widget cannot own a long-running
thread: when it is destroyed, the thread outlives it or is destroyed while
running.

**Instead:** `api.run_in_background(fn, key=...)`, or a `LoopService` owned by
the runtime.

### ❌ Do not subclass QThread and override `run()` with a `while` loop

```python
class NetworkMonitor(QThread):
    def run(self):
        while self._running:
            ...
            self._condition.wait(self._mutex, 30000)   # 30s
```

**What it caused:** the process would not exit. `quit()` does nothing for a
thread with no event loop, and the thread was parked in a 30-second wait, so
`wait(1000)` always timed out. Shutdown then closed the database and HTTP client
underneath the still-running thread. The user had to kill the terminal.

**Instead:** `LoopService` — QObject + `moveToThread` + `QTimer`, so the thread
runs a real event loop and `quit()`/`wait()` are deterministic.

### ❌ Do not call `wait()` on a worker from the GUI thread

```python
worker.quit()
worker.wait(1000)     # on the UI thread
```

**What it caused:** a full second of frozen UI per call — and `quit()` was a
no-op for these workers, so the timeout always elapsed. Called roughly twice a
second because of the storm above.

### ❌ Do not put a lock around every HTTP request

```python
with self._lock:
    response = self._client.request(...)   # 10-30s timeouts
```

**What it caused:** the entire process serialised behind the slowest request.
A single hung call blocked the GUI thread, the sync consumer and the network
monitor simultaneously — the direct cause of the loader that never resolved.
`httpx.Client` is already thread-safe and pools connections.

---

## Lifecycle

### ❌ Do not start threads before `QApplication` exists

```python
network_monitor.start()          # QThread started...
sync_queue.start()
app = QApplication(sys.argv)     # ...created here
```

**What it caused:** undefined behaviour. Queued signal delivery had no event
loop to target, so early emissions were silently dropped and startup ordering
varied between runs — a major contributor to the non-determinism.

### ❌ Do not close shared resources while threads may still use them

```python
sync_queue.stop(); sync_queue.wait(1000)   # returns False, thread alive
self.api_client.close()                    # _client = None
self.local_cache.close()                   # _conn = None
```

**What it caused:** `NoneType` errors inside the still-running worker, swallowed
by broad `except Exception: pass`, leaving threads alive and the process
unkillable. The 4 MB un-checkpointed WAL in `~/.monitra` was the evidence that
the process was routinely being killed rather than exiting.

**Instead:** close shared resources only after every service is *confirmed*
stopped. `ApplicationRuntime.shutdown()` enforces that ordering.

### ❌ Do not do blocking work in `closeEvent`

The audited handler performed a synchronous batch upload and a
`stop_time_entry(timeout=3.0)` network call inside `closeEvent`. Quitting
appeared to hang.

**Instead:** persist durably and let the next run finish the work.

### ❌ Do not use `terminate()` as normal shutdown

It is a last resort, used only when the alternative is a process that never
exits, and it always logs the service name, state and last error. If it appears
in a log, that is a bug to investigate — not normal operation.

---

## State and data

### ❌ Do not let a widget be the source of truth for elapsed time

The audited build had **four** independent counters: `TrackingManager`,
`TaskRow._local_tick`, `TaskSection._running_elapsed_seconds`, and
`SidebarWidget._tick_live_timer`. They incremented separately and disagreed.

**What it caused:** displayed time that did not match tracked time, and
double-counting in Total Time Today.

**Instead:** read `api.timer_elapsed_seconds()`. There is one number.

### ❌ Do not derive elapsed time from `time.monotonic()`

```python
self._start_monotonic = time.monotonic()
def get_elapsed_seconds(self):
    return int(time.monotonic() - self._start_monotonic) + self._elapsed_offset
```

**What it caused:** `time.monotonic()` has no meaning across processes, so
nothing survived a restart except a per-second counter snapshot. A missed write
— crash, kill, disk contention — silently lost time, **sometimes resetting
tracked time to `0`**.

**Instead:** `elapsed = now_utc − started_at_utc`, with `started_at_utc`
persisted once.

### ❌ Do not write to SQLite from the GUI thread on a timer

`TrackingManager._on_tick` committed the timer state **every second** on the GUI
thread, contending with the sync consumer for the same shared connection.

**Instead:** persist on state transitions only. If elapsed time is derived from
a timestamp, there is nothing to re-persist.

### ❌ Do not share one SQLite connection across threads

One `sqlite3.Connection` with `check_same_thread=False`, guarded by a global
`threading.Lock`, was shared by the GUI thread, sync thread, network thread and
every worker.

**What it caused:** every database call in the process contended on one lock, so
a background write stalled the UI.

**Instead:** `StorageManager` gives each thread its own connection.

### ❌ Do not use `threading.local()` for anything owned by a Qt thread

```python
self._local = threading.local()

def connection(self):
    conn = getattr(self._local, "conn", None)
    if conn is None:
        conn = self._new_connection()      # runs on EVERY call from a Qt thread
        self._local.conn = conn
    return conn
```

**What it caused:** an unbounded connection leak. `threading.local` keys its
storage on the thread *object* from `threading.current_thread()`. For a thread
Python did not create — every Qt thread — CPython synthesises a `_DummyThread`
on demand and lets it be garbage collected, so the next call gets a brand new
thread object and therefore empty thread-local storage. Every database call
from a service thread opened a fresh `sqlite3.connect()`: measured at **2,004
connections for 2,000 queued operations**, memory climbing 79 KB → 8 MB across
a two-minute soak and still rising.

**Instead:** key on `threading.get_ident()`, which is stable for the life of
the thread. Because ids are recycled, the owning thread must also release its
entry as it stops (`release_thread_resources`), so a future thread cannot
inherit a dead thread's connection.

### ❌ Do not race a queued cleanup slot against `QThread.quit()`

```python
QTimer.singleShot(0, worker, worker.request_stop)   # releases resources
thread.quit()                                        # exits the loop
```

**What it caused:** both are events; whichever is processed first wins. When
`quit()` won, the worker's cleanup slot never ran and its database connection
leaked — one per service, per restart.

**Instead:** have the worker quit its *own* event loop as the last step of its
cleanup slot, so ordering is guaranteed. Keep an external `quit()` only as the
fallback for a worker that is blocked inside a tick and never reaches its slot.

### ❌ Do not run a multi-statement update outside a transaction

```python
conn.execute("DELETE FROM tasks WHERE project_id = ?", ...)
for t in tasks:
    conn.execute("INSERT INTO tasks ...")
conn.commit()
```

**What it caused:** a concurrent reader running between the DELETE and the
INSERTs saw an empty or partial task list and rendered placeholder rows — the
reported "task name renders as `?`" defect.

### ❌ Do not let a failed request reset valid local state

Cached data must stay on screen when a refresh fails. Blanking a view that is
showing valid local data because the network blipped is a regression, not error
handling.

### ❌ Do not let a stale response overwrite newer state

Guard on identity and on session generation:

```python
if self._current_project.get("id") != project_id:
    return   # the user navigated away; discard this response
```

`TaskRunner` additionally drops any callback whose session generation no longer
matches, so user A's slow response cannot mutate user B's session after a
logout/login.

### ❌ Do not present mock data as if it were the user's own

```python
apps_to_show = self._apps if self._apps else MOCK_APPS
```

Hardcoded sample screenshots, applications and URLs were displayed whenever real
data was absent, which made unimplemented features look like working ones.

**Instead:** show an honest empty state.

### ❌ Do not fabricate a metric the app cannot measure

If activity capture is unsupported on the platform, record the window as
unmeasured and say so. Never substitute a plausible-looking number.

---

## Naming

### ❌ Do not overload `start()`, `stop()` or `state()` on a service

`TimerService.start(project_id, task_id)` shadowed `BaseService.start()`, so
`ServiceManager.start_all()` tried to start a time entry with no arguments and
crashed startup. `NetworkService.state` shadowed `BaseService.state`, so the
service manager read connectivity where it expected lifecycle.

**Instead:** the domain verbs are `start_tracking` / `stop_tracking` /
`switch_tracking`, and the domain property is `network_state`. `start()`,
`stop()` and `state` belong to the service lifecycle.

---

## Error handling

### ❌ Do not swallow exceptions

```python
except Exception:
    pass          # found throughout the audited workers
```

**What it caused:** the actual failure path was invisible. Errors from a closed
database connection, a dead HTTP client and a crashed worker all vanished
identically, which is why the crashes were "silent".

**Instead:** log with `exc_info`, then decide. `TaskRunner` logs every worker
exception with a full traceback before routing it to `on_error`.

### ❌ Do not leave a loader without a terminal state

Every load must reach `SUCCESS`, `EMPTY`, `ERROR` or a recoverable fallback. A
timeout that hides the cause is not a fix — log which component blocked, present
a usable state, and go fix the cause.

### ❌ Do not let one failed request block unrelated sections

Sections load independently. A failure in one must not leave another spinning.

---

## Notifications

### ❌ Do not let a widget own a notification's dismissal timer

If the widget is destroyed, the timer is orphaned and the toast never dismisses.
`NotificationService` owns exactly one dismissal timer.

### ❌ Do not emit a notification per state transition without throttling

Network flapping produced a burst of toasts. Notifications are de-duplicated by
key within 20 seconds and capped at 6 per minute.

### ❌ Do not ship without an explicit Windows App User Model ID

Without `SetCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID`, Windows attributes toasts to
an autogenerated identifier (usually the Python interpreter) instead of to
Monitra. That is what the audit screenshots showed.

---

## Sync

### ❌ Do not run more than one queue consumer, or a second retry loop

`SyncService` is the only consumer, and `api.enqueue(...)` is the only producer
API. Feature modules must not implement backoff, retries, or their own queue.

### ❌ Do not reach into a service's private members

```python
action_id = self._sync_queue._cache.enqueue_action(...)   # from a widget
```

That bypassed every invariant the service maintained.

### ❌ Do not retry without jitter

Exponential backoff alone means every client that lost the backend at the same
moment retries at the same moment. Backoff is jittered 50–150%.

### ❌ Do not queue an operation that references an id the backend has not issued

```python
# Timer started offline, so there is no entry id yet
enqueue("stop_timer", {"entry_id": None, ...})
```

**What it caused:** the stop was sent with `entry_id = None`. It stopped
nothing and left the entry running on the server. Worse, `stop_timer` has a
*higher* queue priority than `start_timer`, so it ran **before** the start that
would have created the entry.

**Instead:** give the pair a shared `client_op`. The start writes its new entry
id onto any queued action waiting for it, and the stop defers until it has one.

### ❌ Do not cancel an action just because its prerequisite is not queued yet

The first version of the fix above cancelled a stop when no matching start was
found in the queue. But a user who stops one second after starting leaves the
start request still in flight *on the task pool*, not yet failed over to the
queue — so there was nothing to find, and the stop was cancelled, orphaning the
entry the start went on to create. Found by the soak test.

**Instead:** defer against a bounded budget (`MAX_STOP_DEFERRALS`), then give
up. "Not there yet" and "never coming" are different conditions.

### ❌ Do not let deferring consume the retry budget

Waiting on an ordering dependency is not a failure. `defer_count` is tracked
separately from `retry_count`, so an action that waits legitimately does not
exhaust the retries reserved for genuine errors.

### ❌ Do not treat a `409` as a failure to retry

The server's state already reflects the intent. Treat it as success and
reconcile, otherwise the client retries forever against a conflict it caused.
