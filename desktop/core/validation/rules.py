"""The desktop's copy of the shared input-rule catalogue.

These numbers and patterns are a deliberate mirror of
``backend/app/core/validation/rules.py``. The duplication is intentional: the
desktop client must be able to tell someone their description is too long
while they are still typing it, and it must be able to do that offline, with
no round trip and no shared package to install.

**The backend remains the authority.** Nothing here is a security control. A
value that passes these checks is still validated again on the server, because
the server also serves browsers, ``curl``, and anything replaying a captured
request. What these rules buy is that a person finds out about a problem at the
moment they can fix it, and that the sync queue does not fill up with requests
the server is going to refuse.

If you change a limit, change it in the backend and the frontend too.
``tests/test_validation_framework.py`` asserts these numbers match the
backend's by reading both files, so a one-sided edit fails the suite.

This module is pure stdlib on purpose. It imports no Qt, owns no thread, holds
no state, and touches no service — see ``ARCHITECTURE.md``. It lives under
``core/`` only because ``core/`` is where shared, dependency-free machinery
belongs, not because it needs any of the infrastructure layer's privileges.
