"""
core.service — Service lifecycle, ownership and health.

Every long-running background service in Monitra has exactly one owner (the
ApplicationRuntime's ServiceManager), one lifecycle path, and an observable
health state. This replaces the previous situation where threads were started
from module-level code, owned by transient widgets, or not owned at all.

Two base classes are provided:

`BaseService`
    A service with no thread of its own — it runs on the GUI thread and does
    its work through the shared TaskRunner. Most services are this.

`LoopService`
    A service that owns a dedicated QThread for a periodic loop. Crucially it
    uses the **QObject worker + moveToThread + QTimer** pattern rather than
    subclassing QThread and overriding run(). That matters for shutdown: the
    thread runs a real Qt event loop, so `thread.quit()` genuinely returns it,
    and `thread.wait()` completes deterministically. The old code subclassed
    QThread with a `while` loop blocked in `QWaitCondition.wait(30s)`, where
    `quit()` did nothing and the 1000 ms `wait()` always timed out — leaving a
    running thread behind at process exit (the zombie-process bug).
