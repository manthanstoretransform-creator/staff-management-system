"""
core.single_instance — guarantee at most one Monitra process per user.

Two copies of this application running at once is not a cosmetic problem. It
is the packaged-build form of the duplicate-worker failure DO_NOT_DO.md
documents: two TimerServices deriving elapsed time, two SyncServices draining
the same durable queue (uploading each row twice, or fighting over the
idempotency keys that are supposed to prevent exactly that), two
AppUsageServices writing overlapping activity windows, and two writers on one
SQLite database.

Packaging makes this markedly easier to hit than a source checkout did. An
installed build has a Start Menu entry, a desktop shortcut, an optional
startup entry and a tray icon, and closing the window *hides to tray* rather
than exiting — so "I closed it, I'll open it again" produces a second
process, and the user cannot tell, because the first one has no window
either.

The lock is held for the entire process lifetime and released by the OS on
exit, including a crash or a kill. There is deliberately no manual release
path and no stale-lock cleanup to get wrong:

    Windows   A named mutex. The kernel destroys it when the last handle
              closes, which happens on process exit however that occurs. The
              name is also what the installer checks (`Global\\MonitraRunning`
              in packaging/windows/monitra.iss) to refuse to overwrite a
              running installation — the two must stay in sync.

    macOS     An flock() on a file in the data directory. flock is released
              on process exit; a leftover lock *file* is harmless because the
              lock itself, not the file's existence, is what is tested.

The lock is per-user, not per-machine: two different people signed into the
same machine are two independent Monitra users with separate data
directories, and must both be able to run it.
