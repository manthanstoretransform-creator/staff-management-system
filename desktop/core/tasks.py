"""
core.tasks — Bounded, owned background task execution.

Replaces the previous pattern of "one QThread subclass per API call, deleted
from inside its own run()". That pattern was the direct cause of two
production failures found in the audit:

  * `BaseWorker` subclasses declared their own `finished = Signal(...)`, which
    shadowed `QThread.finished`. Every `worker.finished.connect(deleteLater)`
    therefore destroyed the QThread from inside `run()` — producing
    `QThread: Destroyed while thread is still running`.
  * Nothing bounded how many workers could exist, so a signal storm spawned
    two new OS threads per second indefinitely.

The replacement is a single QThreadPool owned by the ApplicationRuntime:

  * bounded concurrency (no thread pileup, no thundering herd),
  * results delivered to the owning thread via queued signals,
  * cooperative cancellation,
  * de-duplication by key so the same request cannot be in flight twice,
  * session-generation guarding so stale results from a previous login can
    never mutate the current session's state.

Nothing here touches the GUI. Callbacks are invoked on the thread that owns
the `TaskRunner` (the GUI thread), via a queued signal.
