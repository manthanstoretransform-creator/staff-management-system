;  Inno Setup script for the Monitra desktop client.
;
;  Build it with (from desktop/ -- scripts/build_installer.ps1 does this for
;  you and passes the version automatically):
;
;      iscc /DAppVersion=<version> packaging\windows\monitra.iss
;
;  Input:  dist\Monitra\           (the PyInstaller onedir build)
;  Output: dist\installer\Monitra-Setup-<version>.exe
;
;  Why Inno Setup rather than NSIS or a zip: it produces a single signed-able
;  .exe, handles upgrade-in-place and a real Add/Remove Programs entry with no
;  scripting, and -- the deciding factor here -- supports a genuine
;  non-administrator install, which is what this application needs (see
;  PrivilegesRequired below).

; than a second,
; parallel installation with its own uninstall entry (1.1.0 installed over
; 1.0.x must replace it, not sit beside it).

; PrivilegesRequired=lowest is a deliberate product decision, not a
; convenience. Monitra needs no administrator rights at any point: it reads
; the foreground window title, counts input events through a normal
; user-level hook, talks HTTPS out, and writes only to the user's own home
; directory. Requesting elevation for that would be both a UAC prompt users
; are right to distrust and an unnecessary privilege on a machine running a
; monitoring tool. With `lowest`, {autopf} resolves to
; %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs, which is user-writable -- so installs, upgrades
; and uninstalls all work for a standard user with no IT involvement.
