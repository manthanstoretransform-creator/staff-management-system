PyInstaller build spec for the Monitra desktop client — Windows and macOS.

Usage (from desktop/, after `pip install -r requirements.txt pyinstaller` and
`python tools/generate_app_icon.py` — see BUILD.md for the full procedure):

    pyinstaller packaging/monitra.spec --distpath dist --workpath build/work --noconfirm

Output:
    Windows   dist/Monitra/Monitra.exe  (plus supporting files alongside it)
    macOS     dist/Monitra.app          (plus the same onedir tree inside it)

One spec covers both platforms deliberately. The two builds differ only in
the icon format, the version metadata container, and the macOS-only .app
bundle — duplicating a second spec to express that would mean every future
change to the excludes list had to be made twice, and the two would drift.

What "lightweight" means here: this app only ever imports PySide6.QtCore,
QtGui, QtWidgets, QtSvg, and QtSvgWidgets (confirm with
`grep -rhoE "from PySide6\.[A-Za-z0-9_.]+" --include="*.py" .` from
desktop/) — no WebEngine, Qml/Quick, Multimedia, Charts, Sql, Pdf,
Bluetooth, 3D, or any of PySide6's other ~25 submodules, each of which ships
by default and adds tens of MB. EXCLUDED_PYSIDE6_MODULES below excludes
exactly those; that list is the single biggest lever on the final size,
bigger than onefile/onedir or UPX.
