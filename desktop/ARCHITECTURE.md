# Monitra Desktop — Runtime Architecture

This document describes how the Monitra desktop application is put together at
runtime: who owns what, what starts when, what stops when, and which rules must
hold for the application to stay stable. It is the reference for extending the
application safely.

Read [DO_NOT_DO.md](DO_NOT_DO.md) alongside it. That file lists the specific
anti-patterns found during the production-stability audit, each with the failure
it actually caused.

---

## 1. Ownership model

Everything long-lived hangs off a single `ApplicationRuntime`
([core/runtime.py](core/runtime.py)). There is exactly one, created once, after
`QApplication` exists.

```
ApplicationRuntime
├── StorageManager            one owner of SQLite; per-thread connections
├── LocalCache                repository API over StorageManager
├── ApiClient                 pooled HTTP, no global lock
├── SessionManager / AuthService / ProjectService / TaskService / TimeEntryService
├── TaskRunner                bounded pool for one-shot background work
└── ServiceManager            owns every long-running service
    ├── RecoveryService       runtime liveness, unclean-shutdown detection
    ├── NotificationService   notifications + system tray
    ├── NetworkService        the authoritative network state
    ├── SyncService           the durable queue's only consumer
    ├── TimerService          the authoritative tracked time
    ├── ActivityService       keyboard/mouse activity capture
    └── AppUsageService       foreground-application tracking
```

**The rule:** every thread and every service has exactly one owner, and that
owner is the runtime. Widgets, dialogs and feature modules own neither.

UI code never touches this graph directly. It receives a `BackgroundApi`
([background_services/public_api.py](background_services/public_api.py)), a thin
facade with a documented surface. `tools/check_architecture.py` enforces that
boundary mechanically.

---

## 2. Startup sequence

Ordering here is deliberate; see [main.py](main.py).

```
1. QApplication                      no QThread may exist before this
2. ApplicationRuntime                storage opens; no threads started yet
3. inspect_previous_run()            clean or unclean shutdown last time?
4. restore_session()                 local only — never waits on the network
5. MainWindow construction           shell is built
6. window.show()                     ← the UI is visible and usable from here
7. mark_ui_ready()
8. start_services()                  ← first background thread starts
9. recovery.recover()                adopt durable state from the last run
10. begin_startup()                  verify token, reconcile, in background
```

Two properties matter:

- **No thread starts before the Qt event loop exists.** Starting a QThread
  before `QCoreApplication` is undefined behaviour; queued signals have no event
  loop to target, so early emissions are dropped and startup ordering varies
  between runs.
- **The UI is usable before any remote call completes.** Cached projects, tasks
  and timer state render immediately; the backend reconciles afterwards.

### Loader contract

Every loading state must reach a terminal state: `SUCCESS`, `EMPTY`, `ERROR`, or
a recoverable fallback. Nothing may remain in `LOADING`.

`MainWindow` enforces this with a `STARTUP_BUDGET_MS` guard: if session
verification has not resolved in time, the blocking component and full runtime
health are logged, and the user is given a usable screen. **The timeout is a
backstop, not a fix** — if it fires, the log names what to investigate.

---

## 3. Shutdown sequence

`ApplicationRuntime.shutdown()` is idempotent and always terminates.

```
1. record clean-shutdown intent      while the DB is still fully available
2. TaskRunner.shutdown()             stop accepting work; cancel in flight
3. ServiceManager.stop_all()         reverse registration order:
                                       producers → consumers → monitors
4. api_client.close()                only now
5. storage.close()                   only now; checkpoints the WAL
```

Steps 4 and 5 happen **after** every service thread is confirmed stopped.
Closing shared resources while threads were still using them was one of the
audited defects: it produced `NoneType` errors inside workers, which were
swallowed, which left threads alive and the process unkillable.

Per service, `LoopService.on_stop` does:

```
queued request_stop()  →  thread.quit()  →  thread.wait(timeout)
                       →  if still alive: log name, state and last error,
                          then terminate() as an absolute last resort
```

`terminate()` is never part of normal shutdown. If you see it in a log, there is
a bug to fix.

**Quitting is always explicit.** `setQuitOnLastWindowClosed(False)` means
closing the window can hide to tray while tracking continues. `aboutToQuit` is
the single shutdown path, so the same sequence runs however the exit was
triggered.

---

## 4. Threading model

Two patterns, and no others.

### One-shot background work → `TaskRunner`

```python
self.api.run_in_background(
    lambda: self.task_service.get_tasks_for_project(project_id),
    on_success=self._on_tasks_loaded,
    on_error=self._on_tasks_error,
    key=f"load-tasks:{project_id}",     # de-duplication
)
```

- Bounded concurrency (default 4). Pool threads never expire, so the number of
  SQLite connections is bounded too.
- `key` de-duplicates: the same request cannot be in flight twice.
- Callbacks are delivered on the GUI thread via queued signals.
- Results are **generation-guarded**: if the session changed while the task ran,
  the callback is skipped (see §8).
- Exceptions are logged with a traceback and routed to `on_error` — never
  swallowed.

### Long-running loops → `LoopService`

QObject worker + `moveToThread` + `QTimer`. The thread runs a real Qt event
loop, which is what makes `quit()` effective and `wait()` deterministic.

Subclass and implement `tick()`, returning the milliseconds until the next call:

```python
class MyService(LoopService):
    name = "my_service"
    def tick(self) -> Optional[int]:
        ...
        return 5000
```

`tick()` runs off the GUI thread and must never touch a widget — emit a signal.

**Never subclass QThread and override `run()` with a `while` loop.** That was
the old pattern: the loop parked in a 30-second `QWaitCondition.wait()` that
`quit()` could not interrupt, so shutdown always timed out and left the thread
running.

### What the UI thread must never do

Long HTTP requests · queue draining · retry waiting · screenshot compression ·
large SQLite writes · blocking file I/O · `QThread.wait()` on any worker.

---

## 5. Storage and SQLite concurrency

`StorageManager` ([storage/manager.py](storage/manager.py)) is the only module
that may open, share or close a connection.

- **One connection per thread**, created lazily in thread-local storage, never
  shared. `check_same_thread` stays at its safe default.
- **WAL journal mode**, so readers never block the writer.
- **`busy_timeout=10s`**, so concurrent writers wait rather than raising.
- **Explicit transactions** via `transaction()` for every multi-statement
  update.
- Connections are closed once, last, by the runtime.

Access path — no shortcuts:

```
UI / features  →  BackgroundApi  →  services  →  LocalCache  →  StorageManager  →  SQLite
```

> Why transactions are not optional: `cache_tasks()` deletes a project's rows
> and re-inserts them. When those were separate autocommitted statements, a
> reader running in the gap saw an empty or partial list and rendered
> placeholder rows — the "task name shows as `?`" defect.

---

## 6. Timer: the source of truth

`TimerService` ([background_services/timer/timer_service.py](background_services/timer/timer_service.py))
owns tracked time. **No widget may keep its own elapsed counter.**

```
elapsed = now_utc − started_at_utc
```

`started_at_utc` is an absolute timestamp written durably **once**, when the
timer starts. That single decision provides the guarantees:

- Recovery after a crash is exact, not approximate.
- There is no per-second SQLite write on the GUI thread.
- A UI refresh, widget rebuild, cache refresh, sync, reconnect, minimise or
  restart cannot change the number, because none of them touch
  `started_at_utc`.

States: `IDLE → STARTING → RUNNING → STOPPING → STOPPED`, plus `RECOVERING`.

The one-second `QTimer` emits a display tick only. If it never fired,
`elapsed_seconds()` would still be correct.

> Naming: the tracking verbs are `start_tracking` / `stop_tracking` /
> `switch_tracking`. `start()` and `stop()` belong to `BaseService` and are the
> *service* lifecycle. Overloading them made `ServiceManager.start_all()` try to
> start a time entry with no arguments. The same applies to
> `NetworkService.network_state` versus `BaseService.state`.

---

## 7. Sync: durability and idempotency

`SyncService` is the **only** consumer of the durable queue, and
`enqueue()` is the **only** way to schedule sync work. No feature module may
run its own retry loop.

Queue rows carry: `operation_id`, `action_type`, `entity_type`, `entity_id`,
`payload`, `idempotency_key`, `status`, `priority`, `retry_count`,
`next_retry_at`, `last_error`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `session_generation`.

States: `pending → processing → {complete | retry | failed | cancelled}`.

Guarantees:

- **Durable** — survives crash, restart, offline and backend outage.
- **Idempotent** — a `UNIQUE` index on `idempotency_key` plus a pre-check, so
  two threads racing on the same key cannot both insert. A `409` from the
  backend is treated as success, because the server's state already reflects
  the intent.
- **Bounded retries** with exponential backoff **and jitter** (50–150%). Jitter
  is not cosmetic: without it, every client that lost the backend at the same
  moment retries in lockstep on recovery.
- **Claims are released** on shutdown and on startup, so nothing is stranded in
  `processing`.
- **Ordering is explicit, not implied by priority.** An operation that
  references an id the backend has not issued yet (a timer started offline,
  then stopped) carries a `client_op` shared with the operation that will
  create it. The producer writes the resulting entry id onto every queued
  action waiting for it; the dependent action raises `DeferAction` until it has
  one, against a bounded budget, then `UnresolvableAction`. Deferring tracks
  `defer_count` separately from `retry_count`, so waiting on ordering never
  consumes the retries reserved for genuine errors.

### Signals are edge-triggered

`queue_drained` fires once on the non-empty → empty transition.
`pending_count_changed` fires only when the number changes.

> This is the single most important invariant in the file. The old consumer
> emitted `queue_empty` on *every* 500 ms poll of an empty queue, and the
> dashboard reloaded all data on each one — two new QThreads and two HTTP
> requests per second, forever. Instrumented reproduction measured 48 worker
> threads in 25 seconds. **Never connect a UI slot to a polling signal.**

---

## 8. Session safety

Both a monotonic **session generation** and a **queue floor** protect against
work from a previous login affecting the current one.

- `bump_session_generation()` on login and on logout.
- `TaskRunner` records the generation at submission and drops the callback if it
  changed — so user A's slow response cannot mutate user B's UI or cache.
- `runtime.queue_floor_generation` is raised on logout; the sync consumer
  cancels any queued action from below it, so A's queued operations can never
  execute under B's token.
- Logout also clears app-usage records, activity samples and app state.

---

## 9. Network states

`NetworkService` is the single authority. Both the UI and the sync consumer
subscribe to it. There is no second monitor.

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `UNKNOWN` | Not yet probed. **The initial state** — never assume online. |
| `NO_NETWORK` | The API host is not routable from this machine. |
| `BACKEND_REACHABLE` | Healthy. |
| `BACKEND_UNREACHABLE` | The machine has a network; the backend is down or 5xx. |
| `AUTH_REQUIRED` | The server answered 401/403 — reachable, credentials stale. |

`USABLE = {BACKEND_REACHABLE, AUTH_REQUIRED}`.

- **Hysteresis** — three consecutive failures to degrade, one success to
  recover. One failure is noise.
- **Ordering** — probes are strictly sequential on one thread, so a stale result
  cannot overwrite a newer one. This is structural, not probabilistic.
- **Jittered intervals**, so a fleet does not probe in lockstep after an outage.
- `NO_NETWORK` and `BACKEND_UNREACHABLE` are distinguished by a cheap socket
  check, so a backend outage is never reported to the user as their internet
  being down.

---

## 10. Activity

Pipeline, end to end:

```
InputProbe (GetLastInputInfo)  →  per-second sample  →  60s aggregation window
  →  activity_samples table  →  SyncService batch upload  →  UI / screenshots
```

`activity_percent = active_seconds / window_seconds`, computed from what was
actually measured. Raw counts are stored alongside it so the displayed number is
auditable against its inputs.

**The percentage is never fabricated.** If input detection is unsupported on the
platform, windows are recorded as unmeasured and the UI says so. If no timer is
running, nothing is recorded.

### Backend contract still required

The desktop client now captures and stores activity, but **the backend has no
activity endpoint or schema** — there is no `activity_percent`, keyboard or
mouse field anywhere in `backend/app`. Until it exists:

- samples accumulate locally and drive the in-app percentage;
- `SyncService._sync_activity()` is a no-op, guarded on the presence of
  `TimeEntryService.batch_sync_activity`, so it does not retry into a 404 loop.

To finish the feature, the backend needs a migration adding activity columns to
the screenshot/time-entry tables, a `POST /time-entries/{id}/activity/batch`
endpoint, and a `batch_sync_activity` method on `TimeEntryService`. The client
will begin uploading as soon as that method exists.

**Screenshot capture and URL tracking are likewise not implemented** in the
client; it only reads screenshots the backend already holds. The mock fallback
data that previously made these tabs look populated has been removed, so the
tabs now show honest empty states.

---

## 11. Notifications and tray

`NotificationService` owns notification delivery *and* the system tray icon.

- One owned dismissal timer — a dismissal timer can no longer be orphaned by a
  widget being destroyed.
- **De-duplication** by key within a 20-second window, and a ceiling of 6
  notifications per minute, so network flapping produces one message rather than
  a burst.
- **`SetCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID`** is called before the tray icon
  is created. Windows derives the name and icon on a toast from the process's
  App User Model ID; without an explicit one it falls back to an autogenerated
  identifier, which is what the audit screenshots showed.
- A missing tray is logged and degrades to log-only. It never silently disables
  application behaviour.

---

## 12. Window lifecycle

| Action | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Close window | Prompt (unless remembered): quit, minimise to tray, or cancel |
| Minimise to tray | Window hides; **all services keep running** |
| Restore | From tray icon, tray menu, or taskbar |
| Explicit quit | Full controlled shutdown via `aboutToQuit` |

`closeEvent` does no blocking work. The audited version performed a synchronous
3-second network call and a batch upload there, which is why quitting appeared
to hang. Anything outstanding is durable and completes on the next run.

---

## 13. Crash recovery

`RecoveryService` maintains a durable runtime record (`pid`, `last_heartbeat`,
`clean_shutdown`, `session_generation`) written every 15 seconds and flagged
clean on deliberate exit.

On startup:

```
inspect_previous_run()  →  unclean?  →  release stranded queue claims
                                     →  recover the timer from its durable record
                                     →  reconcile with the backend
```

Recovery is **idempotent by construction**: it adopts persisted records rather
than replaying operations, so running it twice yields the same state and cannot
create duplicate time entries.

---

## 14. Extending the application safely

**To run something in the background:** `api.run_in_background(...)` with a
`key`. Do not create a thread.

**To schedule something durable:** `api.enqueue(...)`. Do not write a retry
loop.

**To add a long-running service:** subclass `LoopService`, register it in
`ApplicationRuntime.__init__` in dependency order (producers after the consumers
they feed, since shutdown is the reverse), and expose what the UI needs through
`BackgroundApi`.

**To show tracked time:** read `api.timer_elapsed_seconds()`. Do not count.

**To react to sync or network state:** connect to the edge-triggered signals on
`api.sync` / `api.network`. Never to a polling signal.

### Checks

```bash
python tools/check_architecture.py            # ownership boundary
python -m pytest tests/                       # regression suite
python tests/soak/run_launch_cycles.py        # 10 launch/quit cycles
python tests/soak/run_soak.py --duration 120  # scale + soak
```

The boundary check fails the build if feature code touches `QThread`,
`QThreadPool` or `QRunnable`, imports a service implementation instead of
`public_api`, or resurrects one of the removed modules.
