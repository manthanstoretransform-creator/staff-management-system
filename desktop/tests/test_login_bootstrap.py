"""
Coverage for the login -> dashboard handoff.

The reported symptom was a dashboard that opened empty after a successful
login and only filled in "after a delay". Measured, the cause was that
`refresh_data()` -- the only path that loads projects -- refused to run
unless NetworkService had already *committed* a usable state. At startup that
state is UNKNOWN, which is the absence of a measurement, not a measured
outage; a user who has just authenticated has proved the backend answers.
With projects never requested there is no project selection, so no tasks
either, and the screen stayed empty until a probe committed or the 120-second
refresh timer came round.

These tests pin the handoff: what the first load depends on, that it happens
once, and that none of it can carry the previous user's data or token.
