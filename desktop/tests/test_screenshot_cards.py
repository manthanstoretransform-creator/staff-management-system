"""The Screenshots tab renders real captures, in IST, with real activity.

Three defects were reported from a running build, and all three were visible
on screen as confident, plausible, wrong information:

* the thumbnails were gradients drawn by a `SimulatedScreenshotWidget`, not
  the user's screen;
* the capture times were the backend's UTC values printed verbatim, so a
  7:34 PM capture was labelled 2:04 PM;
* every card read "0% Activity", because the endpoint it fetched carries no
  activity at all.
