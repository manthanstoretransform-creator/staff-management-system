"""
Coverage for date-scoped activity: the day window, the desktop's retention
windows, and the midnight split.

Three separate failures are guarded here, each of which showed up as "the
numbers are wrong" and each of which has a different cause:

  1. **All-time totals.** The Apps and URLs summaries used to ask the backend
     for everything and to add every pending local row, so last week's usage
     sat in today's list. Both halves of the merge must be filtered by the same
     day window.
  2. **A day that is not the day.** An inclusive `23:59:59` upper bound drops
     the final second; a UTC day instead of an IST one shifts everything by
     five and a half hours.
  3. **Midnight.** A segment that runs from 23:59:40 to 00:00:40 is one row
     with one timestamp; stored whole it credits the whole minute to the
     earlier day.

No Qt application and no network: this is arithmetic, filtering and string
handling.
