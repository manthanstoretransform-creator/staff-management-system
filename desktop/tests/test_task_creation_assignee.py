"""
Coverage for who a new task is assigned to, and for what the user is told
when the backend refuses one.

The production bug this locks down: Add Task assigned every task to whoever
was signed in (`self._user_id or 1`). The backend only accepts an active
*employee* who is a member of the project as an assignee, so the request
succeeded for an employee creating their own task and failed with HTTP 400
for every admin and leader. It looked like an account-specific authentication
fault; it was a payload the client could not have got right, reported through
an error message that discarded the backend's explanation.

The dialog stays simple -- name and description, no assignee field. An
employee's task is assigned to them; anyone else creates it unassigned and
gives it an owner through Edit Task.
