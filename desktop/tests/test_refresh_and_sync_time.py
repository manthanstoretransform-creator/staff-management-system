"""
Coverage for the Refresh button's contract.

Refresh re-fetches everything the dashboard shows -- projects, task
statuses, the selected project's tasks and the viewed day's time entries --
and only then advances the "Last sync" timestamp the sidebar displays. A
refresh in which any fetch failed must leave that timestamp exactly as it
was: reporting a sync that did not happen is worse than showing an older
time.

The fake runner below mirrors how BackgroundApi actually delivers results:
callbacks are queued, so none of them can run until after refresh_data() has
returned. Running them inline would not exercise the real ordering.
