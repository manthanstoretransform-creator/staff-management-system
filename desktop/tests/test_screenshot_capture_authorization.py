"""The rule that only an actively tracked task may cause a screenshot.

The whole of this file protects one sentence: **no active running time entry
means zero new captures.** The application being open, the user being logged
in, the window sitting in the system tray and this service being started are
each, on their own, not permission to photograph someone's screen.

The interesting failure is not "does the scheduler start" — that was already
gated. It is the gap between scheduling and capturing. The schedule is armed
on the GUI thread; the capture runs on a pool thread some milliseconds or
minutes later, and a stop can land in between. So these tests assert against
`capture.capture_primary_monitor` itself: not that the file was deleted, not
that the queue row was skipped, but that **the screen was never read at all**.
An image that is never taken cannot leak; one that is taken and deleted was
still taken.
