"""
Coverage for the macOS input-counting backend.

These tests exist because of a real crash: on macOS 26.5.2 (arm64), starting
a timer killed the packaged application instantly with

    EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP)
    _dispatch_assert_queue_fail  <- HIToolbox TSMGetInputSourceProperty
                                    called off the main dispatch queue,
                                    from pynput's own listener thread

pynput's macOS keyboard listener translates every key event to a character
through Carbon's Text Services Manager. That assertion failure raises a
signal, not a Python exception, so the `try/except` around `listener.start()`
could not — and can never — contain it. The only fix is to never call that
API, which Monitra does not need to: it counts events and deliberately never
decodes which key was pressed.

So the load-bearing assertion in this file is the negative one:
`test_macos_never_imports_pynput`. If someone reinstates pynput on macOS, the
application starts crashing again on every timer start, and that test is what
says so.

Everything here runs on any platform: the Quartz layer is faked, because the
point is the decision logic and the wiring, not Apple's API.
