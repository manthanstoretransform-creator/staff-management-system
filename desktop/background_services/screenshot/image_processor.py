"""
screenshot.image_processor — Raw capture to a 1000x1000 WebP.

The processing order matters and is fixed:

    scale proportionally to fit  ->  centre on a 1000x1000 canvas  ->  RGB
    ->  encode WebP  ->  step the quality down until the target size is met

Scaling to fit and padding, rather than resizing to 1000x1000 directly, is what
keeps a 16:9 desktop from being squashed into a square. A distorted screenshot
is not a smaller screenshot, it is a wrong one — text in it stops being
legible, which is the entire reason the image is captured.

The quality search is adaptive rather than a single hardcoded number because
screen content varies by two orders of magnitude in entropy: a terminal encodes
to a few kilobytes at quality 72, a photo-editing session does not. A fixed
quality therefore means either bloated text captures or unreadable dense ones.
The search stops at `WEBP_QUALITY_MIN`, and if even that is over target the
larger file is kept — an oversized readable screenshot beats a small useless
one, and the real size is recorded either way.
