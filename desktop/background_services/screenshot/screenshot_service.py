"""
screenshot_service — Captures screenshots while, and only while, time is tracked.

Ownership
---------
Registered with `ApplicationRuntime` and driven by `TimerService` through the
same `start_tracker` / `bind_entry_id` / `stop_tracker` contract the activity,
app-usage and URL trackers already use. It runs no retry loop (the durable
queue and `SyncService` do that) and never touches the UI.

Unlike those trackers this is a `BaseService`, not a `LoopService`, and owns no
thread. They sample once a second and genuinely need a loop; this one acts
roughly once every ten minutes, so a dedicated OS thread would sit idle for
99.9% of its life. Episodic work belongs on the shared bounded pool — which is
what `TaskRunner` is for, and what DO_NOT_DO.md prescribes instead of a thread
per job. The pool never expires its threads, so this adds neither a permanent
thread nor an extra SQLite connection.

What the schedule does
----------------------
A single-shot `QTimer` on the GUI thread is armed for the next planned capture
instant — it schedules, it does not poll, and an idle window costs one wake-up
rather than a tick per second. When it fires, the capture, the encode and the
queue write are submitted to the task pool under one de-duplication key, so
none of that work can ever run on the GUI thread and two captures cannot
overlap.

The per-window budget survives a restart: how many captures a window has spent
is persisted in `app_state` under `SCREENSHOT_WINDOW_KEY`, so relaunching
Monitra four minutes into a window cannot take a second screenshot the window
has already paid for.

Nothing here uploads. A capture is processed, written to the daily cache and
registered in the durable queue; `SyncService` drains that queue and deletes
the local file only once the backend confirms storage.

What authorises a capture
-------------------------
Tracking, and nothing else. The application being open, the user being logged
in, the window being minimised to the tray and this service being started are
all irrelevant on their own — `start_tracker` is the only thing that arms the
schedule, and `TimerService` is the only caller of it. Authentication is not
tracking.

Because the schedule is armed on the GUI thread but the capture runs on the
pool, "tracking was live when this was scheduled" is not the same claim as
"tracking is live now": a stop can land in between. Every capture therefore
re-checks immediately before it touches the screen, against a generation token
that `start_tracker` and `stop_tracker` both advance. A callback left over from
a stopped timer, a previous task, or a previous tracking session cannot match
the current generation, so it aborts before capturing rather than capturing and
deleting afterwards — an image that is never taken cannot leak.

        whether this machine can capture — and that question is asked from
