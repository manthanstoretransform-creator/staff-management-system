"""
network_service — The single authoritative source of network state.

Replaces `sync/network_monitor.py`, which had four defects that together
produced the reported "Online / Online (Slow: 2.3s) / Offline" flicker:

  * it assumed `is_online = True` before the first probe ever ran, so the UI
    published a state it had not measured;
  * a single transient failure flipped the state immediately — no debounce, no
    hysteresis;
  * it could not distinguish "this machine has no network" from "the backend
    is down" from "the token expired", so a 500 from the API read as offline
    and paused the sync queue;
  * it subclassed QThread with a `while` loop parked in a 30-second
    `QWaitCondition.wait()`, which `quit()` cannot interrupt.

This service runs on the `LoopService` pattern (QObject + moveToThread +
QTimer), so shutdown is deterministic. Probes are strictly sequential on one
thread, which is what makes stale-result-overwrites-newer-result structurally
impossible rather than merely unlikely; a monotonic probe sequence is still
recorded and published so consumers can reason about ordering.
