"""
idle_service — Detects inactivity, and owns every idle-period operation.

Division of responsibility
--------------------------
The desktop detects that the user stopped touching the machine. The **backend
decides everything else**: how long the idle period actually was, whether the
time counts, and where reassigned time lands. Nothing here computes tracked
time, and nothing here edits it.

Why the detection lives in a service rather than in the dialog
--------------------------------------------------------------
Idle detection has to keep working while the main window is minimised or
hidden in the tray, and the popup that results is transient. A transient
widget owning a long-running detector is the exact pattern that destabilised
this application before (see DO_NOT_DO.md). So the runtime owns the detector
and the API calls; the dialog is a view that renders this service's state and
calls two methods on it.

Where the inactivity reading comes from
---------------------------------------
`ActivityService.idle_seconds()` — the Windows `GetLastInputInfo` reading that
already drives the activity percentage. No new global listener is installed:
there is still exactly one place in the process that observes system input.
On a platform where that reading is unavailable the service reports itself
unsupported and never fires, rather than guessing.

Duplicate prevention
--------------------
An explicit state machine, plus the backend's own idempotency:

    MONITORING → REPORTING → PENDING → RESOLVING → MONITORING
                                    ↘ REASSIGNING ↗

Only `MONITORING` can open a period, only `PENDING` can be resolved or
reassigned, and every transition happens on the GUI thread. A retried report
carries a `client_event_id`, and a second report while one is pending returns
the period that already exists, so neither a network retry nor a race can
produce two popups or two idle periods.
