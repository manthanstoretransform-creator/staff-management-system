"""
background_services.public_api — The supported surface for UI and features.

UI and feature modules must import from **this module only**. They must not
import service implementations, and must never touch QThread, worker
lifecycles, sync-queue internals or network polling internals directly. That
boundary is enforced by `tools/check_architecture.py` in CI.

The rule exists because the audit traced several production failures to
feature code owning runtime concerns: transient widgets owning long-running
threads, a dashboard slot wired straight to a queue-internal signal (which
produced the two-threads-per-second storm), and per-widget elapsed-time
counters competing with the timer's own state.

Everything here is a thin, intention-revealing call onto the runtime.
