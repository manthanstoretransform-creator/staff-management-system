"""
app_usage — Application-usage aggregation for display.

Extracted from `ui.workers.LoadAppUsageWorker` so the logic is a plain,
testable function rather than a QThread subclass. It merges what the backend
has already recorded with what is still queued locally, so usage captured
while offline is visible immediately instead of only after a successful sync.

The summary is for **one IST calendar day**, and both halves of the merge are
filtered by the same day window. It used to ask the backend for everything it
had and to add every pending local row regardless of when it was recorded, so
the Apps tab showed an all-time running total: five hours of editor use from
last Monday were still sitting in this morning's list.

    Build the ranked application-usage summary for one IST calendar day.

    Runs on a background thread via the shared task pool. It must not touch
    any widget.

    The remote read is issued **before** the local one, deliberately. A pending
    row is deleted locally only after its upload has been acknowledged, so a
    segment that finishes uploading between the two reads is counted once
    (locally) rather than twice. Reading local first would open the opposite
    window: the row could be absent from the local read and present in the
    remote one — or, worse, present in both — and the tab would flash a doubled
    total during every sync.

    :param api_client: ApiClient used to fetch the backend summary.
    :param cache: LocalCache; unsynced local records for the same day are
        merged in, so an offline day still shows its real totals.
    :param user_id: Optional user filter. The backend pins a caller without
        `time_entries:view_all` to their own records regardless.
    :param day: The IST calendar day to summarise. Required in practice; it
        defaults to None only so an older positional call cannot silently ask
        for an all-time total — that case now returns nothing to aggregate.
    :return: Rows ready for rendering, ordered by descending duration.
