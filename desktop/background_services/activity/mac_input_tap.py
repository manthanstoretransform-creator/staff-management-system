"""
mac_input_tap — keyboard/mouse *event counting* on macOS, via a Quartz event tap.

This exists because pynput's macOS keyboard listener crashes the entire
application on current macOS. Its listener thread translates every key event
to a character through Carbon's Text Services Manager:

    pynput/_util/darwin.py: keycode_context()
        -> TISCopyCurrentKeyboardInputSource()
        -> TISGetInputSourceProperty(...)

Those are HIToolbox APIs, and on macOS 26 they assert that they are called on
the main dispatch queue. Called from pynput's own listener thread, the
assertion fails inside `dispatch_assert_queue`, which raises SIGTRAP — an
`EXC_BREAKPOINT` that **cannot be caught by Python**. The process dies
instantly. Observed on macOS 26.5.2 (arm64) the moment a timer was started:

    Thread 33103 Crashed:
    0  libdispatch.dylib  _dispatch_assert_queue_fail
    2  libdispatch.dylib  dispatch_assert_queue
    3  HIToolbox          islGetInputSourceListWithAdditions
    5  HIToolbox          TSMGetInputSourceProperty
    8  _ctypes            _ctypes_callproc
    ...                   pynput listener thread

No amount of try/except around `listener.start()` helps, because the fault is
a signal raised on another thread, not a Python exception. The only fix is to
never call that API — which this module does not need to, because Monitra
counts events and deliberately never decodes which character was typed.

So this is a direct `CGEventTap` in listen-only mode. It sees the event type
and, for modifier keys, the layout-independent virtual keycode. It never
resolves a character, never consults the keyboard layout, and never touches
TSM. That is both the bug fix and a strictly stronger form of the privacy
contract in `input_counter.py`: the keystroke content is not merely discarded
after the fact, it is never obtained.

Permissions: creating an event tap requires **Input Monitoring** (System
Settings -> Privacy & Security). Without it `CGEventTapCreate` returns None —
it does not raise and does not crash — so the counter reports itself
unsupported, counts stay at zero, and activity falls back to "unmeasured",
exactly as the documented degradation describes.

Threading: one plain Python thread running a CFRunLoop, owned and stopped
deterministically by `stop()`. Not a QThread — the architecture checker's
prohibition concerns Qt threading, and a CFRunLoop cannot be hosted on one.
