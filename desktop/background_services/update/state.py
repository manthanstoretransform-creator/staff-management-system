"""
The update state machine, and the release descriptor it moves through.

Why a machine and not a few booleans
------------------------------------
Everything that can go wrong with an updater goes wrong through concurrency:
two checks in flight, two dialogs on screen, two downloads writing the same
file, two installers running at once. Booleans do not prevent that — they
record it after the fact. A single ``state``, with the legal transitions
declared in one table, does: a transition that is not in the table is refused
and logged, so "download while already downloading" cannot happen by accident
regardless of which signal arrived twice.

The states mirror the flow exactly once each:

    IDLE ─▶ CHECKING ─▶ UPDATE_AVAILABLE ─▶ DOWNLOADING ─▶ VERIFYING
                                                              │
                    FAILED ◀───────────────────────────────────┤
                                                              ▼
                                        INSTALLING ◀── READY_TO_INSTALL

`FAILED` is reachable from every working state and leads back to `IDLE`,
because a failed update must always leave a usable application behind — that is
the whole safety property of this feature, and a machine that could get stuck
outside `IDLE` would be a way to lose it.
