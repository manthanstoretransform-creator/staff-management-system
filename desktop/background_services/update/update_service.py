update_service — finds a newer Monitra release, and applies it on request.

Scope, and what changed
-----------------------
This began as "Phase 0": it announced a release and stopped there. It now also
downloads, verifies and installs one — but only ever when the user asks, and
only ever an artifact whose SHA-256 matches what the backend said. The
announcement half is unchanged, and the download half is strictly additive: a
deployment that answers without a checksum still produces exactly the old
behaviour, an announcement and a link.

Design constraints this service is built to, all of them from DO_NOT_DO.md:

**No new mechanism.** It is a `LoopService` like every other periodic service,
registered with `ApplicationRuntime`, notifying through the `NotificationService`
that already owns notifications and running its download on the shared
`TaskRunner`. No new thread, no new timer, no second notification path, and no
queue of its own.

**Edge-triggered, never level-triggered.** The backend keeps answering "1.1.0 is
available" every time it is asked. Notifying on each answer would be exactly the
level-triggered signal that once produced a notification storm, so the
announcement fires only when the announced version *changes* — once per release,
per session — and the dialog is offered on the same edge.

**The backend decides.** Whether an update exists, and whether it is mandatory,
are the server's answers, not comparisons made here. One rule, in one place.

**It holds instead of failing.** Unauthenticated, offline, or a backend that
does not implement the endpoint (an older deployment, which is a normal state
during a rollout) are all reasons to wait quietly. A failed update check must
never be able to affect tracking, and must never lock anyone out.

**Nothing is installed that was not verified.** The state machine in `state.py`
is what makes "download while already downloading" impossible rather than
unlikely, and `ReleaseInfo.from_payload` is the trust boundary: a payload that
is missing a digest, or carries a URL that is not absolute HTTPS, yields no
installable release at all.

The ten-hour schedule
---------------------
The check runs about every ten hours, and that has to survive a restart —
someone who closes Monitra at 22:30 and opens it at 08:00 has been away longer
than the interval and should be told about a release immediately, while someone
who restarts twice in a minute should not produce two checks. So the time of the
last *successful* check is persisted, and the delay before the first check of a
session is computed from it. A failed check never moves that timestamp, which is
what stops a backend outage from silently postponing the next attempt by ten
hours.
