"""
Fetching an update artifact, and proving it is the one the backend named.

The whole safety property of this module is one sentence: **the installed
application is never touched.** A download writes to a scratch directory under
the user's data directory, and only a file whose SHA-256 matches the digest the
backend gave is ever handed to the installer. Every failure path — no network,
a truncated body, a wrong digest, a full disk — ends with the artifact deleted
and the application exactly as it was.

Design notes worth keeping:

**Hashing happens during the download, not after it.** One pass over the bytes
as they arrive, rather than writing the file and reading it back. A 100 MB
installer is not large, but reading it twice doubles the I/O for no benefit,
and a second pass introduces a window in which the file could change between
the write and the check.

**Cancellation is checked between chunks.** A download can take minutes, and
shutdown must not wait it out. `should_stop` is consulted on every chunk, so
the worst case is one chunk's transfer — not one file's.

**Nothing here touches Qt.** It runs on the update service's own thread and
reports progress through a plain callable, so it is directly testable without a
QApplication and cannot accidentally touch a widget.
