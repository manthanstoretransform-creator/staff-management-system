# Build Monitra.app and Monitra-macOS-<arch>-<version>.dmg.
#
# Run on macOS only. This script cannot be run on Windows or Linux and does
# not pretend to be: a macOS application bundle contains Mach-O binaries and
# Qt frameworks for the host architecture, produced by the host's own
# toolchain, and codesign/hdiutil exist only on macOS. Cross-building one from
# Windows is not possible, and a file produced that way would not be a macOS
# application. Use the macOS runner in .github/workflows/desktop-release.yml,
# or a real Mac.
#
# Architecture: the build is native to the machine it runs on -- arm64 on
# Apple Silicon, x86_64 on Intel -- and the artifact is named accordingly. It
# is deliberately NOT built as a universal2 binary: PySide6 publishes separate
# per-architecture wheels rather than universal ones, so a universal bundle
# would require merging two independently built Qt trees, and claiming
# "universal" without having tested both halves on real hardware is exactly
# the sort of unverified claim this project does not make. Ship one DMG per
# architecture instead.
#
# Usage (from desktop/):
#     ./scripts/build_macos.sh
#     ./scripts/build_macos.sh --clean
#
# Signing and notarization are opt-in, driven entirely by the environment --
# no credential is ever read from a file in the repository. See BUILD.md.
#
#     MONITRA_CODESIGN_IDENTITY   e.g. "Developer ID Application: Acme (TEAMID)"
#     MONITRA_NOTARY_PROFILE      a `xcrun notarytool store-credentials` profile
#
# With neither set, the result is an unsigned .app and .dmg, which is correct
# for internal testing and NOT suitable for public distribution: Gatekeeper
# will refuse to open it on any Mac that did not build it.
